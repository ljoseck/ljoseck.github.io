Oh, I frequently think every now and then/
of the glorious fruit of the noble hen/
eggs, eggs, E, double-G, S-eggs./
My knowledge of eggs is tremendously wide./ 
I’ve eaten them boiled, I’ve eaten them fried./ 
Poached and shirred/ 
and deviled and scrambled,/ 
hummeled, shmummeled,/ 
cuddled, and frammeled./
I’ve eaten them beaten and swizzled and swuzzled./
Frizzled, cadizzled, bamboozled, and fuzzled./
I know every way that an egg can be guzzled./
And thinking of eggs/
reminds me of Sam./
Whose favorite dish./
Is green eggs and ham./
