	During my Junior year in the class Software Engineering II five students and I created Game of Codes. Game of Codes is an educational side-scrolling-queued-puzzle-platformer-web-based video game. The goal of the game is to write programming commands to move the player around obstacles to a finish flag. Allowing the player to learn simple programming concepts such as simple program structures and control flow. Each of the 6 levels has elements to let the player learn either a new tool or skill. This lets the player have fun while still learning.

	I was responsible for creating the game engine and game play of our game. I used an Interpreter design pattern to run the programs written by the user. This interpreter used asynchronous actions to allow for the animation of the gameplay. Each frame is rendered from map objects that hold the information of the game. Each tile of the game board is created by an overlay of different sprites.

	While much of the functionality of the demo is solely my creation there is much of the application that is not on this website. The entire backend of our application was created to allow the users to log in and track their progress among other functionality.
