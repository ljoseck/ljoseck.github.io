    	<a href="https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">The game 2048</a>
		was hot on the internet in 2014. After becoming addicted to such a simple game I thought it would be interesting to program this game on Ti-Basic. After two weeks of pondering the hurdles you would need to leap I knew it was possible with my current understanding to recreate this game. I spend just an afternoon creating the entire game with only a few bug fixes later.
