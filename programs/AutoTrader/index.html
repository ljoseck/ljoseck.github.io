	I created this automatic trader application as a personal project back in high school as I got more interested in programmatic automation. This application would take screen rips of a game to trade items to real people in game to make a profit. These items were valued in real currency, when left running unwatched the application would profit one dollar per hour.

	I did not realize the long-term success of this application when I started this creation, and caused a faster development time yet harder to change application. Beneficially this let me make some critical mistakes that I am now mindful of and have learned from. In the code of this application there exists many confusing pixel coordinates that should have been more descriptive constants. This would also solve the fact that some of these coordinates are repeated making updating the application much harder. I did properly separate processes into different functions allowing for an easy change in planed execution. I do wish I had followed a reuse design pattern as many of the functionalities share a core pattern that could have been abstracted. This would allow for faster additions of new functionality by only requiring changes a few variables.
