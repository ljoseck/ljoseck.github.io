    	SkyRidge is a single player RPG for the TI84 calculators. I created this game when I was in high school before I took any computer science classes. I would copy the program on to friends' calculators to let them play and give me feedback. This is the second version of Skyridge because I rewrote my first version. I rewrote it because I learned new methods in programming such as arrays and Ti-Basic drawing features. This allowed me to create a much better program that I am proud of.
