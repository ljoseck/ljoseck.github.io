    	SkyRidge is a single player RPG for the TI84 calculators. I created this game when I was in high school before I took any computer science classes. I would copy the program on to friends' calculators to let them play and give me feedback. This is the second version of Skyridge rooting from a rewrite of a early version. I rewrote it because in my experiences I learned new methods in programming such as arrays and Ti-Basic's drawing functionality. This allowed me to create a much better program that I am proud of.
