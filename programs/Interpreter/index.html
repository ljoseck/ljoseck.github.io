    	This interpreter was a project for my Concepts of Programming Languages class. This interpreter computes Boolean expressions. We were given the syntax and semantic rules for the expressions and tasked the create this interpreter. After completing this project, I recreated the interpreter to show the stack while it runs while also adding a delay between functions. main.js contains the project I submitted while main2.js contains the recreated project. I adjusted the interpreter.html to contain a checkbox to switch between running main.js and main2.js.

An example input would be:<br>
T^(FvT->~T). <br>
T represents True, F represents False, ^ represents and, v represents or, -> represents implies, ~ represents not. Each Boolean expression must end with a period.
